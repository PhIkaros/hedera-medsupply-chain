Overview: MedSupply Chain is a Web3-powered solution that ensures the traceability and authenticity of medicines from factory to patient. By leveraging Hedera Hashgraph, each batch of medicine receives a unique, immutable identifier recorded on the ledger, allowing every stakeholder — manufacturers, distributors, pharmacies, and patients — to verify authenticity in real time.

How it works:

Each medicine lot is registered on Hedera with a tamper-proof digital ID.
Every step in the supply chain (manufacturer → distributor → pharmacy → patient) is recorded as an event on the ledger.
Integrated AI algorithms analyze logistics data to detect anomalies such as suspicious breaks, overstocking, or fake entries.
Patients and regulators can scan a QR code to instantly verify the medicine’s authenticity.
Key Technologies:

Hedera Hashgraph (DLT) for traceability and transparency
AI / Machine Learning for anomaly detection
QR Code system for easy verification
Web dashboard for supply chain visualization
Impact:

Protects patients from counterfeit medicines
Builds trust and transparency in pharmaceutical supply chains
Strengthens public health safety and accountability
